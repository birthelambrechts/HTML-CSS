## Exercise

The exercise will be simple: you are given [an HTML file](./assets/index.html) that you have to style. That means you will have to get *creative* in using CSS selectors. Try to challenge yourself and integrate some new things in this exercise (transitions, animations, hover effects, rounded borders, different list icons, ...).  

**You can choose whether you want to make your own design, or try to simulate someone else's. Just be aware that the only point of this exercise is for you to learn: don't try to take the easy way out and copy someone else's code entirely.**

**Rules of the game**
* You are not allowed to edit the HTML file.
* You should write **at least** 200 lines of CSS. (excluding empty lines, obviously)
* Integrate a font that is appropriate with the style of the website.
* Use flexbox and/or CSS grid to position elements on your website.

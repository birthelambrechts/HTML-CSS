## Exercise

You are contracted by a client (Rafael Lambelin) to create a section of their website. The client gave their pitch, and now it's up to you!

Use your knowledge of HTML, CSS & Bootstrap to realise the client's request. **This project isn't finished until the client is satisfied!** If you have any questions regarding expectations, feel free to ask the client, but remember: the client is not a programmer!

The client's project already uses Bootstrap, so you should take full advantage of that. However, feel free to add your own CSS. Just make sure that it doesn't interefere with the already-existing project.

**Monday morning (24/06/2019), everyone will have to pitch their final version to the client!**

_**Note:** Before starting to code, it's best to make a prototype. That way, you can more easily discuss the style and markup of the project._

## Goals

After this chapter, you should have acquired the following technical competencies/skills:

**Practical**

- [ ] Able to use markdown syntax.
- [ ] Able to write professional `README.md`'s.
- [ ] Understand the utility of `README.md`'s.



## What is markdown?

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.



## Exercises



### Exercise 1

Look up or make a cheatsheet with the most-used Markdown syntax. Compare this with the other people at your table. Shortly discuss the pro's and cons of the different cheatsheets, and then pick one you would like to use.


### Exercise 2

This will be a group exercise (steps below)! In short, we are going to make a repository (project), and have different people work on it!

* **Step 1**  
Go to your Github account and go to repositories: click `New`. Give the repository the name `md-q-and-a` and initialize it with a `README.md`.

* **Step 2**  
Click the button to `Clone/download`. Now copy the SSH URL (you can copy the HTTPS URL but then you will have more work). Navigate your way to the terminal and perform the following command: `git clone url-you-just-copied`.

* **Step 3**  
Open the `README.md` in a text editor (easiest is to use a non-terminal-based editor, every OS normally has one installed by default). Write a question you would like to ask one of your group members. Additionally, also supply how you would like the answer to be formatted (e.g. bold, italic, spoiler, table, list, ...). **Make it as challenging as possible!** Then save the file.

* **Step 4**  
Execute the following steps to push your edited `README.md` online:
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m ""` (enter you own commit message between the quotes)
    * `git push`

* **Step 5**  
Add the people in your group as collaborators of you repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository. Once you have done this, they will receive an e-mail, where they can accept your invitation to collaborate.

* **Step 6**  
Clone the repository (`pull` if you already cloned it once) of one of the other people in your group. Open their `README.md` and answer the question. Then write a new question yourself (and the supply the format of the answer). **Communicate about who is going to `push` and `pull` what at which point to avoid merge conflicts!**

* **Step 7**  
Execute the following steps to push your edited `README.md` online:
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m ""` (enter you own commit message between the quotes)
    * `git push`

Repeat step 6 & 7 until every `README.md` contains 5 questions and answers!
